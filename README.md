About
-----
A Fully-Automated Workflow for Reproducible Ensemble Graph Analysis of Functional and Structural Connectomes

PyNets harnesses the power of Nipype, Nilearn, Dipy, and Networkx packages to automatically generate graphical ensembles on a subject-by-subject basis, using virtually any combination of graph-generating hyperparameters. PyNets utilities can be integrated with any existing preprocessing workflow, and a docker container is provided to uniquely facilitate complete reproducibility of executions.
