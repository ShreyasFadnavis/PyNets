About
-----
PyNets is a tool for sampling and analyzing varieties of individual structural and functional connectomes. PyNets enables the user to specify any of a variety of methodological choices  impacting node and/or edge definition, and then sample the prescribed connectome estimates in a massively parallel framework that is conducive to predictive optimization (i.e. grid-search). PyNets is a post-processing workflow, which means that it can be run on virtually any preprocessed fMRI or dMRI data. It relies on Dipy, Nilearn, Networkx, and the Nipype workflow engine under-the-hood. It can now also be deployed as a BIDS application, where it takes BIDS derivatives and makes BIDS derivatives.
