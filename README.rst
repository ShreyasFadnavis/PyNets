About
-----
A Reproducible Workflow for Structural-Functional Connectome Sampling, Ensembles, Optimization, and Analysis

PyNets harnesses the power of Nipype, Nilearn, Dipy, and Networkx packages to automatically generate graphical ensembles on a subject-by-subject basis, using any combination of graph-generating hyperparameters. PyNets utilities can be integrated with any existing preprocessing workflow, and a docker container is provided to facilitate reproducibility of executions.
